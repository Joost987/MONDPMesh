# MONDPMesh
Python N-body code made for MOND simulations.

This code uses an altered particle mesh method to solve the Poisson equation of the AQUAL version of MOND. It was made for my Bachelor's thesis. The thesis can be found at https://repository.tudelft.nl/.


Required libraries:
Numpy, math, itertools, these are all included in base Python
Pyfftw, which needs the C FFTW library. It's documentation can be found in https://pyfftw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
